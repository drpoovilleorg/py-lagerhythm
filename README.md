py-lagerhythm 0.1
==============

This is a simple Python/Flask app which uses the 'tweepy' library
to capture text and GPS coordinates and pass along to twitter.

There is also a Perl/CGI version called "Lagerhythm" which was initially
written before porting this to Python.

In order to utilize this you'd need to create a developer account
for twitter and then obtain the various secret keys needed and enable
GPS geolocation if you want to use that feature.

This was originally hosted on Red Hat's 'Open Shift'
(http://www.openshift.com) and used to track the amount
of draft beer (pivo tocene) I consumed while in the Czech Republic
on work assignment.

This code is under the BSD license so do anything you want with it,
just remember to have fun.  Thanks to @djipko for helping me
hack this to completion in a very short timeframe.

Name credit goes to Nancy Benninger for "lagerhythm" :)
